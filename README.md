# Bus When (Twin Cities)
## The waiting is the hardest part

Check Metro Transit bus arrival times in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area.
Enter the Stop ID shown on your bus-stop sign to see real-time arrival
estimates if available, or scheduled arrival times if not. This is similar to
the NexTrip feature on the official Metro Transit website.
