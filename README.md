# Bus When? (Twin Cities)

Check bus arrival times in the Minneapolisâ€“Saint Paul metro area. Enter the
Stop ID shown on your bus-stop sign to see real-time arrival estimates if
available, or scheduled arrival times if not. This is similar to the NexTrip
feature on the official [Metro Transit](https://www.metrotransit.org/) website, but we aim to do it better.
