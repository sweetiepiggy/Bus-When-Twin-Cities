# Bus When (Twin Cities)

Check bus arrival times in the Minneapolisâ€“Saint Paul metro area. Enter the
Stop ID shown on your bus-stop sign to see real-time arrival estimates if
available, or scheduled arrival times if not. This is similar to the NexTrip
feature on the official Metro Transit website, but we aim to do it better.
